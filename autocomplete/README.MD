## Zsh

Enable Git Tab Autocomplete for Zsh
New Macs use the Zsh shell by default. If youâ€™re using Zsh, add the following line to the ~/.zshrc file and restart your Terminal application:

```zsh
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

Alternatively, you can run the following two commands in your Terminal application to add the necessary line to the .zshrc file and restart your shell.

```zsh
echo 'autoload -Uz compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
Git tab autocomplete is now enabled on your Mac.
